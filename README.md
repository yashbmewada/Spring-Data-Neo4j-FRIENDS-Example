# About the Project.
While working with Neo4j Spring boot API I came across very few examples. The Documentation is existent but even the Neo4j example does not work as intended.
This made me build this example.
It is a maven project which follows the standard Java Spring Boot Repository Pattern.

# Steps to install
  Download, install and start Neo4j Server.

  open the web-interface at http://localhost:7474

  configure a username and password if you havenâ€™t already.

  run :play movies command, and click and run the Cypher statement to insert the dataset

  clone this project from GitHub

  update src/main/resources/application.properties with the username and password you set above.

  run the project with mvn spring-boot:run.
